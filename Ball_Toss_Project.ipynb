    "# Recreation of \"Paper Toss\" Game Using Variable Air Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "_Paper Toss_ was an original game released on Android and IOS by Backflip Studios. The premise of this game is to \"toss\" a paper ball into a trashcan by swiping up on the touchscreen. The challanges arose when a fan was added to alter the trajectory of the ball. To compensate for the wind of the fan, players had to change the angle at which they would swipe in order to succesfully \"make the basket\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Jupyter Notebook is to fundamentally recreate _Paper Toss_ and create a _Ball Toss_ game using variable air resistance, characteristics of a baseball, and other physical relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters used mirror a baseball rather than a paper ball\n",
    "- The initial launch speed stays fixed\n",
    "- The vertical launch angle stays fixed\n",
    "- Inertial Drag is dominant (High Speeds)\n",
    "- User must change horizontal launch angle to be able to score\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory \n",
    "\n",
    "To model the motion of a ball (sphere), we can numerically integrate these first-order differential equations using the RK4 integration technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_x \\qquad \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_y \\qquad \\frac{dz}{dt} = v_z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d v_x}{dt} = \\frac{F_{net,x}}{m} \\qquad \\frac{d v_y}{dt} = \\frac{F_{net,y}}{m} \\qquad \\frac{d v_y}{dt} = \\frac{F_{net,y}}{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the net force is the sum of all forces acting on the ball. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *inertial* drag is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F} = -\\frac{1}{2}C_d \\rho A v^2 \\hat{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This program will be able to model the motion of a ball given a set of initial conditions and parameters. A scene will be created displaying the user the position of the ball, position of the hoop and the direction and strength of the wind.  There will be four different \"situations\" in which the wind will be randomly oriented in. This wind orientation will be decided every time the \"main()\" function is executed. The \"main()\" program will stop once the user selects the correct angle to succesfully score into the hoop. Note: Speeds used are very high and are just meant for gameplay realism, not to mimic the physical real world.\n"

    "\n",
    "This adaptation of _Paper Toss_ seems to work as expected. When experimenting with different wind parameters, it became apparent that only a few situations were usable. If the wind was too strong, sometimes it would be impossible to score into the hoop. The angle would be too large and the ball would fall short of the target. To overcome this issue, the initial launch speed would have to increased. For our purposes, the initial launch speed was kept fixed, but doing so creates a limiting factor within the game. Something else that could be explored in the future is using linear (viscous) drag rather than inertial drag and comparing the game behavior and difficulty between the two.  "
