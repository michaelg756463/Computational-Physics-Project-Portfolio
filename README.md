# Computational-Physics Project Portfolio

## Introduction
This Github Repository contains a collection of Juptyer Notebook files that pertain to different physics modeling projects. These projects are the the result of combining topics from theoretical physics with computational modeling. The various physical topics explored include the modeling of electron flow in a metal, modeling a double pendulum, re-creating a paper-toss game using air resistance, modeling different boundary conditions for a chain of oscillators, and visualizing the time-evoliution of a radiative electric field due to an oscillating electron. The difficulty of the theoretical physics needed to understand these projects is at an undergraduate college level. Each project is written in Python and formatted in a way in which the audience is given background information regarding the project as well as the methods and assumptions used to execute the program. 

## Projects
Below are links to each of the Juptyer Notebooks corresponding to its project. Brief descriptions of each project are given, but a more in depth introduction is given within each Jupyter Notebook.
